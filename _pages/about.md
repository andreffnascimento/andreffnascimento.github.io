My name is André Nascimento, and I am a PhD student <a href="https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic/phd-home">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en">Instituto Superior Técnico (IST)</a>, advised by professors <a href="https://web.ist.utl.pt/jose.fragoso">José Fragoso Santos</a> and <a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~nsantos">Nuno Santos</a>.

I am also a junior researcher at <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt">INESC-ID</a>, where I have contributed to national and European-funded projects, including <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/projects/">DIVINA</a> and <a href="https://www.inesc-id.pt/pt-smart-retail/">SmartRetail</a>.
My research focuses on formal methods for programming languages, with a strong emphasis on safety and security analysis for dynamic web languages like JavaScript.

I am an advocate for well-typed languages that are simple, intuitive, and secure, such as <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>.
I enjoy designing sound, scalable, and practical tools that enable developers to reason about their code and produce safer, higher-quality software.
